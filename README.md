## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a full exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Wintermute’s on-chain DeFi trading activity using a dataset of token transfers from April 8th, 2025. The project was completed as part of the **Quant Researcher Internship assignment** for **Syntagma Labs**.

The analysis focuses on:

- Entity classification (DeFi vs Non-DeFi vs CEX vs Wallet vs Unknown)
- Integration with the public **DeFiLlama API** for protocol identification
- Isolation of Wintermute’s DeFi counterparties
- Token-level, chain-level, and protocol-level analysis
- Temporal activity study (hourly volume)
- Multi-dimensional visualizations (heatmap, histogram, Sankey)

All analysis is performed in the Jupyter notebook in this repository and summarized in the accompanying Google Doc.
